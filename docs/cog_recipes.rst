This is the cog guide for the 'Recipes' cog. This guide contains the collection of commands which you can use in the cog.
Through this guide, ``[p]`` will always represent your prefix. Replace ``[p]`` with your own prefix when you use these commands in Discord.

.. note::

    Ensure that you are up to date by running ``[p]cog update recipes``.
    If there is something missing, or something that needs improving in this documentation, feel free to create an issue `here <https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/discord-plugins/issues>`_.
    This documentation is auto-generated everytime this cog receives an update.

Installation
------------

If you haven't added my repo before, lets add it first. We'll call it
"discord-plugins" here.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]repo add discord-plugins https://github.com/AAA3A-AAA3A/discord-plugins

Now, we can install Recipes.

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]cog install discord-plugins recipes

Once it's installed, it is not loaded by default. Load it by running the following command:

.. code-block:: ini

    [p]load recipes
